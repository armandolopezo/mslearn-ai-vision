        explanation of code in ANALYZE IMAGE section of program image-analysis.py
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation (short)

What it does

Opens the file named by image_file in binary mode ("rb") using a with-context manager.
Reads the entire file contents into image_data via f.read().
Prints a message like "Analyzing path/to/file" (with blank lines before/after).
Key behaviors / types

"rb" = binary mode, so f.read() returns bytes; image_data is of type bytes.
The with statement ensures the file is automatically closed when the block exits.
In the snippet the print is dedented, so it runs after the file is closed (i.e., after the with-block).
Gotchas / improvements

f.read() loads the whole file into memory. For very large images prefer streaming (read in chunks) or memory-mapped access.
Consider exception handling (FileNotFoundError, PermissionError) or checking the file exists first.
Use logging instead of print if this is a library or long-running app.
If you only need the filename in the message, consider using pathlib.Path(image_file).name to avoid printing long paths.
Suggested alternatives (streaming and safer messaging)

If you want, tell me whether you prefer a small refactor (streaming, logging, or explicit error handling) and I can produce it.
